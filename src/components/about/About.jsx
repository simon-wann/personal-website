            Hi! I'm Simon, a senior at Baruch College majoring in Computer Information Systems. 
            As a passionate and driven individual, I am dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of technology 
            and its endless possibilities. Currently, I am honing my skills and expanding my knowledge as a Cybersecurity 
            Apprentice, where I have the opportunity to apply my classroom learnings to real-world projects. 
            I am excited about the ever-evolving field of technology and look forward 
            to making meaningful contributions to the digital landscape.
